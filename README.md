Personal list for ideas of things which may be useful to do in future

## Lecture series
- The evils of data
There are lots of hidden examples of data which has been used for "evil" purposes 
or else just misused. It could be a fun idea to take part in a series of lectures where
these are discussed 
  - Some examples:
    - [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyril_Burt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyril_Burt)

## Courses

- Course on how to write a CV and cover letter for a data science role! 

## Misc
