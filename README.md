Personal list for ideas of things which may be useful to do in future

## Lecture series
- The evils of data
There are lots of hidden examples of data which has been used for "evil" purposes 
or else just misused. It could be a fun idea to take part in a series of lectures where
these are discussed 
  - Some examples:
    - [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyril_Burt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyril_Burt)
    - Iris Dataset [https://armchairecology.blog/iris-dataset/](https://armchairecology.blog/iris-dataset/)
  

## Misc

- A talk/tutorial/written guide on "How to organise a thesis with GitHub"
  - Aimed at PhD students 
  - Assumed not extreme git users 
  - Talk about snapshotting and backing up thesis materials 
  - How issues can be made to track work that needs done 
  - Ghub's project boards could be shown off to manage each chapters goals and targets
  - Include supervisor in discussion
